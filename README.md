# CardioPredict
 Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

This project focuses on building a machine learning pipeline to predict the risk of cardiovascular disease. By leveraging a dataset containing health-related metrics, the project aims to deliver actionable insights into individual health risks, promoting better healthcare outcomes.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:

- Analyze a cardiovascular disease dataset for key health insights.
- Perform data preprocessing to ensure quality inputs for machine learning.
- Develop and train predictive models.
- Evaluate model performance.
- Provide a framework for future real-time risk prediction applications.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes features that capture health metrics relevant to cardiovascular risk factors.

### Key Details:
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Cardiovascular Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com)
- **Instances**: Variable (depends on cleaned dataset).
- **Features**: Health-related metrics like age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.
- **Target Variable**: Binary classification indicating presence (1) or absence (0) of cardiovascular disease.

## Requirements

To replicate or extend this project, you will need:

- **Python** (>=3.x)
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the analysis)

## Project Structure

- `CardioVascularDisease.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis, model development, and visualizations.

## Key Features

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
   - Encoded categorical variables where necessary.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized feature distributions and relationships with cardiovascular outcomes.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Trained various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Assessed performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

5. **Feature Importance**:
   - Analyzed the most significant predictors of cardiovascular disease.

## Results

### Model Performance

| Model                 | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-----------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression   | 85%      | 86%       | 84%    | 85%      |
| Random Forest         | 88%      | 89%       | 87%    | 88%      |
| XGBoost               | 90%      | 91%       | 89%    | 90%      |

### Insights

- Features such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and smoking status were highly predictive of cardiovascular disease.
- Ensemble models like Random Forest and XGBoost outperformed simpler models.

## Future Work

- Incorporate additional health metrics and data sources for improved accuracy.
- Explore deep learning approaches for better predictions.
- Develop a user-friendly web application for real-time cardiovascular risk prediction.
